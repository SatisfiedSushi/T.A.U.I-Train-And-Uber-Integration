#### A project to integrate Uber and Train services in a single web application.
Taui aims to provide a seamless experience for users who wish to use both Uber and Train services to get to their destination. The user will be able to enter their starting location and destination, and Taui will find the nearest train station to the starting location, as well as the nearest train station to the destination. Taui will then find the ideal route to take, factoring in the nearest train stations, and the time it takes to get to the train stations. Taui will then provide the user with a link to book an Uber to the nearest train station, and a link to book an Uber from the destination train station to the final destination. This will allow the user to book both their initial ride, and final ride with ease. 


* We are using a mixture of Python with the Flask library for the backend as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
* We are using the Google Maps API to display the map and find the ideal route factoring in the nearest train stops.
* We are using Uber Deeplinks to redirect the user to the Uber app with the destination already set, allowing them to book both of their rides with ease.
