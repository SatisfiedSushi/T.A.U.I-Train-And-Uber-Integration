#### A project to integrate Uber and Train services in a single web application.
Taui aims to provide a seamless experience for users who wish to use both Uber and Train services to get to their destination. The user will be able to enter their starting location and destination, and Taui will find the nearest train station to the starting location, as well as the nearest train station to the destination. Taui will then find the ideal route to take, factoring in the nearest train stations, and the time it takes to get to the train stations. Taui will then provide the user with a link to book an Uber to the nearest train station, and a link to book an Uber from the destination train station to the final destination. This will allow the user to book both their initial ride, and final ride with ease. 


* We are using a mixture of Python with the Flask library for the backend as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
* We are using the Google Maps API to display the map and find the ideal route factoring in the nearest train stops.
* We are using Uber Deeplinks to redirect the user to the Uber app with the destination already set, allowing them to book both of their rides with ease.

### How to use T.A.U.I

---
1. Go to https://taui.pythonanywhere.com/
2. Input your starting location and destination
3. Click the "Get Route" button
4. Click the "Book Uber" button to book your Uber to the nearest train station
5. Click the arrow button to move on to the next map and see your train route
6. Click the arrow button again to move on to the final map and see your Uber route from the destination train station to your final destination
7. Enjoy your ride!

### Common Errors

---
* Sometimes when you input the name of a location, the map will not display the location. 
This is because the Google Maps API does not recognize the location you entered. 
To fix this, try entering a more specific location, or try entering the address of the location.
* If you haven't enabled location tracking for the website in your settings, the Get Location button will not work as it uses location data.
While sometimes the returned location may be off due to a slight margin of error when geocaching a position. 
To counteract this error you can enter the address of your current location.
* Sometimes the code will send you to a station and make you go from that station to the same station because that is the closest station to your location that will take you near the desired location. 
When experiencing this error only reference the first map which shows an uber, titled "Uber 1". Also, when entering using the uber deeplink you should edit your destination to be your desired final destination instead of teh station.
